# ZalgoPyTool
Simple python tool used to "zalgo" text with varying degrees and also unzalgo text

Made mostly for fun and to learn python3

Requires the pyerclip package to read and write to your clipboard

If you just run it with no arguments it will autmatically ruin your clipboard text 5 times up, down, and through on each charactr

You can run it with the -u flag to change up count, -t flag to change the count through and the -d flag to change the count down

If nothing is specified in the -i flag it automatically uses your clipboard contents

--to-ascii will "unzalgo" the text

The utility will print the output automatically but if you just run it by clicking it you won't be able to see it so it's mostly useful for if you're running it while already in the command line


This is one of my first python projects so this is by no means perfect but if you see an issue I'd appreciate it being pointed out so I won't make the same mistake again
